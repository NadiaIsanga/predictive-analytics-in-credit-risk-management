#  Predictive Analytics in Credit Risk Management

This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess the creditworthiness of bank customers. It integrates robust data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to support risk-based decision-making in credit approval.



##  Summary

Built a predictive model using Random Forest and Logistic Regression to assess credit default risk.  
Applied advanced techniques like SMOTE, feature engineering, and ensemble stacking to improve performance.  
Achieved a maximum accuracy of 74% and provided interpretability crucial for financial decision support.



##  Skills Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas / scikit-learn**
- **Random Forest & Logistic Regression**
- **Predictive Modeling**
- **SMOTE (Oversampling)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **ROC-AUC / F1 Score Analysis**
- **Ensemble and Stacking Models**
- **Threshold Tuning**

## Key Results

- Random Forest (with SMOTE): 74% accuracy, better handling of imbalanced data  
- Logistic Regression: Provided strong interpretability and fast execution  
- Stacking models showed marginal gains; class imbalance remained a challenge  
- Feature importance and threshold tuning explored for model optimization
